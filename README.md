Library using the [JibbSmart/JoyShockLibrary](https://github.com/JibbSmart/JoyShockLibrary) to try to support Sony's DualSense.

## Progress

- An API for all the fancy DualSense things can easily be written.
- Currently struggling trying to get input to Unreal Engine by mapping to the existing GamePad type ***(IN NEED OF HELP)***
